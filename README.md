# student_repayment_loan
This project predicts whether a bank should approve a loan for an applicant based on financial and credit-related factors, using various Ensemble Learning methods. The goal is to assist in risk assessment and decision-making for loan approvals.

# üìä Loan Repayment Prediction Using Ensemble Learning  

## üìå Overview  
This project predicts whether a bank should approve a loan for an applicant based on their credit and financial details, using **Ensemble Learning** techniques. The aim is to assist financial institutions in reducing default risks and making data-driven lending decisions.  

The best-performing model in this project ‚Äî **Random Forest Classifier** ‚Äî achieved an accuracy of **~85%**.
